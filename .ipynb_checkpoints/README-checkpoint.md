# Combinatorics Problem Sets – Based on *A Walk Through Combinatorics*

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for **Combinatorics**, based primarily on the textbook
*A Walk Through Combinatorics* by **Miklós Bóna**.

It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through core combinatorics concepts and example problems to deepen my problem-solving intuition and build a strong foundation for probability, statistics, and machine learning.

## Resource Used

All problems and theory are taken from:

**Miklós Bóna, *A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory***

## Structure & Organization

Each folder corresponds to a major topic (loosely aligned with chapters in the book), and within it are subfiles for notes, problems, and solutions.

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:

* Solved **by hand** on paper first
* Then written up in Markdown files for long-term reference
* Accompanied by distilled notes on key ideas and strategies
* Sometimes simulated or visualized (when helpful)

The goal is not speed, but **true mastery** — as part of my Project10X foundational training in probability and statistics.

## Learning Objectives

* Build deep problem-solving fluency in combinatorics
* Apply combinatorial techniques confidently in probability, inference, and AI
* Gain mastery of foundational tools like:

  * Product and sum rules
  * Permutations and combinations
  * Binomial identities
  * Inclusion-Exclusion
  * Pigeonhole principle
  * Integer partitions and distributions
  * Recursion and generating functions
  * Intro to graph theory (optional chapters)

---

## Tools Used

* Markdown + Git for organized version control
* LaTeX for clean math typesetting
* Python (Jupyter) for simulating and verifying complex counts
