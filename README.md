# Combinatorics Problem Sets – Based on *A Path to Combinatorics for Undergraduates*

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for **Combinatorics**, based primarily on the textbook  
*A Path to Combinatorics for Undergraduates* by **Titu Andreescu and Zuming Feng**.

It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through core combinatorics concepts and example problems to deepen my problem-solving intuition and build a strong foundation for probability, statistics, and machine learning.

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:

- Solved **by hand** on paper first
- Then written up in Markdown files for long-term reference
- Accompanied by distilled notes on key ideas and strategies
- Sometimes simulated or visualized (when helpful)

The goal is not speed, but **true mastery** — as part of my Project10X foundational training in probability and statistics.

  - Product and sum rules
  - Permutations and combinations
  - Binomial identities
  - Inclusion-Exclusion
  - Pigeonhole principle
  - Integer partitions and distributions
